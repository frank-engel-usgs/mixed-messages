# Mixed Messages - Random Sentence Generator
Generate random messages that are entertaining and sometimes even grammatically correct. Written as a simple
NODE.js application, this script will output several random sentences to the console constructed from the supplied 
word lists. Some example outputs:

> One cocky matrimonial law judgmentally swated.
>
> Your goal in life utterly splattered.
>
> Her impertinent idiot helpfully sweet-talked.
>
> Some considerate louse patiently critiqued.

This is a learning project to practice and grow my javascript skills. The orignal "assignment"
is from the [Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) path. 

# Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine in the typical fashion. Open a terminal within the root

# Acknowledgements
Credit due to Hannah Newman's lovely [sentence-generator](https://github.com/mistralnewman/sentence-generator) project for
some of the approach and concept, as well as the lists of prepositions and determiners words. Basically, this project is a refactor of Hannah's approach in JavaScript. 

Also, I used this [Students and Writers](https://www.studentandwriter.com/2018/02/09/funny-mad-libs-word-lists-adjectives-nouns-and-verbs-2/) blog post to get a pretty hilarious list of nouns, adverbs, and verbs.
